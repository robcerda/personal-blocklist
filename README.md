# personal-blocklist

I've accrued a collection of blocklists over the years and instead of messing around with what might be other peoples lists.
My list tends to block generic ads, intended for privacy and trackers, and against known malicious domains. It does not include streaming services or social media sites on purpose; so use something else for that.
